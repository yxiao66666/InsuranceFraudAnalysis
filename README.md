# Insurance Fraud Analysis

## Overview

Insurance fraud is a significant challenge in Australia's general insurance sector, particularly in car insurance. According to the Insurance Council of Australia, fraudulent claims cost insurers hundreds of millions of dollars annually. This not only leads to increased premiums for honest policyholders but also strains the industry's resources.

This project explores a historical dataset of motor insurance claims in Australia. The dataset includes both fraudulent and non-fraudulent records, and covers a range of features such as:

- Vehicle characteristics  
- Driver demographics  
- Accident details  
- Policy information  

By analyzing this data, the project aims to uncover patterns that may indicate fraudulent behavior, contributing to better fraud detection and improved policy management.

## Objectives

The project consists of two main tasks:

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Using **Power BI**, the goal is to:

- Explore and visualize patterns across genuine and fraudulent claims  
- Identify key indicators and trends associated with fraud  
- Generate actionable insights to inform fraud detection and prevention strategies  
- Apply good data visualization principles for clarity and impact  

### 2. Predictive Modeling

Using **RapidMiner**, the goal is to:

- Build and evaluate predictive models to classify claims as fraudulent or genuine  
- Compare the performance of at least two supervised learning algorithms  
- Manually configure models and avoid the use of automated tools or features  
- Interpret and explain model outputs to inform business decision-making  

## Tools & Technologies

- **Power BI**: For interactive dashboards and data visualization  
- **RapidMiner**: For machine learning model building and evaluation  
- **CSV Data**: Historical motor insurance claims data from the Australian context  

## Key Outcomes

- Identification of significant risk factors associated with fraudulent claims  
- Visual dashboards to assist insurers in fraud detection and policy management  
- Predictive models with potential applications in real-world insurance settings  

## Relevance

With the growing importance of artificial intelligence and machine learning in Australia's financial and insurance sectors, this project provides practical insights into how data-driven methods can support fairer and more efficient insurance practices.
